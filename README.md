# BitHub Docker
## Scope
This is to hopefully encourage Moxxie to pick BitHub back up again.  Maybe even just make it a bit more well known so that people will actually push it forward again.

## Disclaimer
The goal is to eventually make it so that it can build this app from the latest stable source but as the creation of this repository/container the default ```maven clean install``` throws Null Pointer Exceptions with the code from the repo.  So I will include one that I built on my Jenkins a year and a bit ago.  I would recommend that you try and fix this on your own and use your own fork maybe so that it will come back to life again.

## Wishlist
[ ] Get this working on a cryptocurrency that doesn't suck overall.
[ ] Get this to a point where it doesn't rely on CoinBase because they're less then ideal.
